**This application allows users to enter in their favorite actors and TV shows, and then view detailed information about those interests on different pages.**

### Overview of Application.
**If you have completed 100% of the homework,** your application should have the following routes, each of which should render the template listed here:

* **http://localhost:5000/ -> base.html**: This is the homepage of the application.
* **http://localhost:5000/movies -> movies.html**: This page allows a user to enter their favorite actor, and if their most popular movie isn't a duplicate, information about it will appear.
* **http://localhost:5000/actors -> actors.html**: This page shows information about every actor that was input on the movies.html page.
* **http://localhost:5000/names -> name_example.html**: This page shows all information that was submitted to the form on the homepage.
* **http://localhost:5000/tv_shows -> tv_shows.html**: This page shows all non-duplicate information about TV shows that was submitted to the homepage.
* **http://localhost:5000/404 -> 404.html**: 404 error page.

### Instructions

### Code Requirements

## To submit

* Commit all changes to your git repository. Should include at least the files:
    * `README.md`
    * `SI364midterm.py`
    * A `templates/` directory with a file `base.html` and `name_example.html` plus the others you have created inside it
* Create a GitHub account called `364W18midterm` on your GitHub account. (You are NOT forking and cloning anything this time, you are creating your own repo from start to finish.)
    * Invite users `aerenchyma` (Jackie), `pandeymauli` (Mauli) and `Watel` (Sonakshi, or `sonakshi@umich.edu`) as collaborators on the repository. [Here's how to add a collaborator to a repository](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d6btsfxgh6z84bx/Screenshot%202018-02-13%2021.32.11.png?dl=0).
* Submit the *link* to your GitHub repository to the **SI 364 Midterm** assignment on our Canvas site. The link should be of the form: `https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/364midterm` (if it doesn't look like that, you are probably linking to something specific *inside* the repo, so make sure it does look like that).

All set!
